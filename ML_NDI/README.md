# The ML aspect of the proposed work

In this directory the scripts corresponding to the "pix2pix" model, which is based on a GAN architecture, is positioned. These scripts stem from the codes available in the following work [pix2pix](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix). 

Specifically, here we utilize the devised GAN model to generate Digital Twins for NDI purposes, based on input RF-wavefronts.
