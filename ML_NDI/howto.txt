install CUDA and cuDNN files for your system. (If not already present)

install anaconda and activate python 3.5.6

Then run: 

pip install protobuf==3.8
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.4.0
pip install scipy==1.1.0
pip install pillow

================ RUNNING
unzip your dataset inside a_folder_you_like.
The folder_you_like must have two subdirs, train and val. Each must be filled with pictures (jpg).
create a list of those files with
dir /b /s > filelist.txt
(remember to remove the "filelist.txt" from this list)
and copy it under THE PRESENT FOLDER

then, train with 
python train.py --train filelist.txt --batch_size 64 (or other power of 2)

--train: Directory of the Text File of Train Filelist
--out_dir: Directory to Save your Train Result
--epochs: Num of Epochs You Want
--batch_size: Batch Size You Want
--direction: 'AtoB' or 'BtoA'
--gpus: 0 to use the first one, 1 to use the second one, etc... or 0,1 to use both (default)
After finish training, saved models are in the ./output/checkpoint directory and the Train Results are saved in ./output/result.(default)

======================================
to test your stuff, 
python test.py --visnum 64 (or more)
(you might want to put another text file here, deleting the previous one, this one containing the "val" contents only.
Also try: 

python test.py --test newfileVAL.txt --visnum 64 (or more)

--test: Directory of the Text File of Test Filelist
--out_dir: Directory to Save your Train Result
--ckpt_dir: Directory of Trained Model
--visnum: batch size
--direction: 'AtoB' or 'BtoA'
--gpus: 0 to use the first one, 1 to use the second one, etc... or 0,1 to use both (default)


)

Test results will be saved in ./output_test(default)
They will be triple figures, [Input | Generated | Ground Truth]
